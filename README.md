# Rocker Bogie CAD Model

This project features a detailed 3D CAD model of a rocker bogie suspension mechanism, created using SolidWorks as part of a self-initiated project in December 2024. The rocker bogie is widely used in planetary rovers due to its ability to traverse rough and uneven terrain with stability and minimal tilt.

## Project Overview

The model replicates the structure and function of a rocker bogie system, emphasizing both visual detail and mechanical accuracy. It was developed to deepen understanding of complex multi-link mechanisms and their real-world applications in mobile robotics and off-road vehicles.

## Key Features

- Modeled all major components: rocker arms, bogies, tie rods, central body, motors, and wheels
- Assembled using correct mates to replicate real-world motion
- Focused on both functional design and clean visual representation
- Designed for educational, simulation, and conceptual prototyping purposes

## Tools Used

- SolidWorks 2023  
- Part Modeling and Assembly Modules  

## Files Included

- `.SLDPRT` – Individual part files  
- `.SLDASM` – Assembly file  
- Rendered images
